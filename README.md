# Codecademy
<br />

From 2022 to present I have worked as a freelance copywriter for Codecademy, an interactive learning platform for people looking to grow their digital skills. 

I work closely with a creative team of designers and writers, as well as CRM, social media, and content leads, to develop ideas and copy for topical and evergreen emails, on-site copy, paid ads, and more.

<br />
<br />
My experience writing marketing and UX copy for Codecademy has allowed me to practice writing with precision and clarity, using my problem solving skills to work with character limits and formatting constraints determined by digital marketing tools like Digioh, Instapage, and Stensul. 

As I work with writers and marketers across multiple teams, it's important that we accurately and consistently describe our product and do so while adhering to our brand style guide. Together with the creative team, I helped develop a glossary of product features that we refer to regularly as we write new email newsletters, social posts, and onsite banners (to name just a few).

### Searchable lesson catalog
Previously, the only way to explore Primer’s offerings was to download the app. To make our content more searchable, I led an effort to overhaul our website. I chose the heading “Lesson Catalog,” and created brief descriptions of Primer’s skills (e.g. Workplace Inclusivity, Career Development, Staffing) and of the macrocategories these skills belong to (e.g. Business & Operations, Brand & Identity), all the while mindful of keywords, SEO, and behavioral science.

### New skills
Below is the launch alert and user flow that went out to existing Primer users when we added 8 new skills to the lesson catalog. This allowed users to review and update their chosen skills, which influences what lessons and minicourses appear in their Home tab.

### Segmented onboarding
To further personalize the app experience for users, we added 4 distinct personas users can pick from, and updated the onboarding process accordingly. When choosing titles for the personas and language for the onboarding screens, I paid close attention to research our marketing team had done on segmented value propositions and consulted with Google’s Behavioral Economics team and Material Design best practices.

Finally, in addition to writing short copy, I turned Primer lessons into longer-form pieces which I have ghostwritten for the Google’s marketing blog Think with Google (link in image below).
