From 2022 to present I have worked as a freelance copywriter for Codecademy, an interactive learning platform for people looking to grow their digital skills.

I work closely with a creative team of designers and writers, as well as CRM, social media, and content leads, to develop ideas and copy for landing pages, on-site UX, emails, paid ads, and more.

My experience writing marketing and UX copy for Codecademy has allowed me to practice writing with precision and clarity. I use problem solving skills daily to work within character limits and formatting constraints determined by digital marketing tools like Digioh, Instapage, and Stensul.

In addition to following Codecademyâ€™s brand style guide, I worked with other writers to develop an up-to-date glossary of product features to ensure we write value propositions and product descriptions that are consistent and accurate.
