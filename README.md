# Codecademy
<br />

From 2022 to present I have worked as a freelance copywriter for Codecademy, an interactive learning platform for people looking to grow their digital skills. 

I work closely with a creative team of designers and writers, as well as CRM, social media, and content leads, to develop ideas and copy for topical and evergreen emails, on-site copy, paid ads, and more.

My experience writing marketing and UX copy for Codecademy has allowed me to practice writing with precision and clarity, adhering to Codecademyâ€™s brand style guide, and using problem solving skills to work with character limits and formatting constraints determined by digital marketing tools like Digioh, Instapage, and Stensul.
